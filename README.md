# Real Estate Price Prediction

[AWS Documentation](http://ec2-13-48-48-90.eu-north-1.compute.amazonaws.com/)

## Overview

This repository contains code for a real estate price prediction model, implemented using machine learning techniques. The model has been trained on a dataset of real estate features and is deployed on AWS for easy access and usage.

## Features

- **Data Exploration:** Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to understand the characteristics of the real estate dataset.
- **Data Preprocessing:** Cleaning, handling missing values, and transforming features for better model performance.
- **Model Training:** Building a machine learning model for predicting real estate prices.
- **AWS Deployment:** Deploying the model on AWS for easy accessibility.

## Project Structure

- `notebooks/`: Jupyter notebooks containing the code for data exploration, preprocessing, and model training.
- `src/`: Python source code for the model and deployment scripts.
- `data/`: Raw and processed datasets used in the project.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook
- AWS Account (for deployment)
